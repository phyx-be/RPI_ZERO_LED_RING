A metal core LED ring that fits the RPi Zero and Rpi Camera. By adding a heatsink or metal plate to the back, this board can run continuously at full power. (which is not possible with the [RPI_HAT_FLASH](http://phyx.be/RPI_HAT_FLASH))

## Hardware Revision 00

The board has been designed around the [Ti TPS61165](http://www.ti.com/product/TPS61165) wide input white LED driver. It has an optional PWM input allowing the RPI to control the brightness of the LEDs. The round hole in the board will fit a [Panasonic EKMC1601113 PIR](http://na.industrial.panasonic.com/products/sensors/sensors-automotive-industrial-applications/pir-motion-sensor-papirs/series/vz-series/2481) which can come in handy to enable or disable the LEDs based on movement detection.

### Known issues

* No markings near power and PWM pads
* Screw holes aren't perfectly aligned for the camera
* Will only work with voltages higher than 8V, optimal 12V
